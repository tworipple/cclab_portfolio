                            Hi, I'm Huanyi (Lydia). I am a MFADT student at Parsons, currently taking Creative Coding Lab.
                            I like working between digital and physical media, especially projects that combine code,
                            visuals, and small objects that make a desk or room feel more alive.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My background includes interactive media, basic web design, and experiments with motion and
                            simple game-like interactions. In this class, I focused a lot on using p5.js to explore
                            themes.
                        </p>

                    <div class="col-12 col-md-6">
                        <h3>Education</h3>
                        <p>
                            I am studying at Parsons School of Design (The New School) in the MFA Design and Technology
                            program. Creative Coding Lab is one of the courses where I started to connect programming
                            with visual storytelling and interaction.
                        </p>

                    <div class="col-12 col-md-6">
                        <h3>Interests</h3>
                        <p>
                            Outside of class, I enjoy play games, photography, and movie.
                            I like activities with groups since I am ENFP in 16 personalities which is love stay with friends.

                        <h3>Career Goals</h3>
                        <p>
                            In the future, I am interested in working in areas related to interaction design,
                            creative technology, or digital installation work. I want to keep learning how to use code
                            as a design material, and how to build experiences that feel both technically thoughtful
                            and emotionally honest.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Thoughts on Technology</h3>
                        <p>
                            My relationship with technology is a mix of curiosity and caution. I like how tools like
                            p5.js, TouchDesigner, and simple sensors can turn feelings or data into visuals, but I also
                            think a lot about pace, overload, and how much of our lives are filtered through screens.

                            This site was built for Creative Coding Lab using HTML, CSS, and p5.js. It collects the
                            assignments I completed this semester (Fall 2025) and shows how my sketches changed over time.
