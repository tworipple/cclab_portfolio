                        <h3>Project Description</h3>
                        <p>
                            For this assignment I made a small circus-themed puzzle game in p5.js.
                            The game is split into three levels, and each level has a slightly
                            different kind of challenge. The player has to pay attention to
                            the animals, directions, and little hints on the screen in order
                            to unlock the next stage.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Visually, I tried to keep a strong “circus poster” feeling: bold
                            colors, repeated shapes, and animals that feel a bit exaggerated.
                            Instead of making a fast arcade game, I wanted this to feel more
                            like a short interactive story where the player slowly discovers
                            the rules by trying things out.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                        <h3>Reflection</h3>
                        <p>
                            This project was a big step up from my earlier sketches because I
                            had to think about structure: states for each level, how to reset
                            variables, and what happens when the player makes a mistake or
                            finishes a stage. I spent a lot of time debugging simple things
                            like collisions and key presses, but that process helped me
                            understand how p5 can be used to build a whole game, not just a
                            single looping animation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I also learned how important feedback is in a game. If the player
                            does the right thing but nothing changes, it feels broken. So I
                            added small visual cues and text hints to show that the game is
                            reacting to them. If I continue this project, I would like to add
                            sound effects, smoother transitions between levels, and maybe a
                            clearer ending screen that wraps up the circus story.
